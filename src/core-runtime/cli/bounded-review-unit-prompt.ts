Unit id: ${unitId}
Unit kind: ${unitKind}
Authoritative prompt packet path: ${packetPath}
Canonical output path: ${outputPath}

Rules:
- Treat the prompt packet below as the authoritative contract.
- Treat the Boundary Policy and Effective Boundary State in the packet as hard constraints.
- Read the files referenced by the prompt packet when needed.
- Stay within the smallest sufficient file set implied by the packet.
- Do not recursively follow reference chains beyond the files explicitly listed in the packet unless the packet requires it.
- Do not use web research when the packet says web research is denied.
- Do not read outside the allowed filesystem scope described in the packet.
- Produce only the final markdown content for the canonical output path.
- Do not wrap the answer in code fences.
- Do not add commentary before or after the markdown.
- Do not modify repository files yourself.
- Do not change the required output structure from the packet.
- If the packet asks you to preserve disagreement or uncertainty, preserve it explicitly.
- If you cannot complete the task within the declared boundary, preserve that limitation explicitly as insufficient access or insufficient evidence within boundary instead of broadening the search.

Authoritative prompt packet follows:

${packetText}
